# WiFi Signal Sensor
#
# The wifi_signal sensor platform allows you to read the signal strength of the currently
# connected WiFi Access Point.
#
# The sensor value is the "Received signal strength" measured in decibel-milliwatts (dBm).
# These values are always negative and the closer they are to zero, the better the signal is.
