# Safe Mode
#
# Sometimes hardware and/or software doesn’t behave as expected. ESPHome supports a “safe mode”
# to help recover from repeated boot failures/reboot loops. After a specified number
# (the default is ten) of boot failures, the safe mode may be invoked; in this mode, all
# components are disabled except serial logging, network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and the OTA component(s).
# In most cases, this will temporarily mitigate the issue, allowing you a chance to correct it,
# perhaps by uploading a new binary.
