# Bluetooth Proxy
#
# Home Assistant can expand its Bluetooth reach by communicating through the Bluetooth proxy
# component in ESPHome. The individual device integrations in Home Assistant (such as BTHome) will
# receive the data from the Bluetooth Integration in Home Assistant which automatically aggregates
# all ESPHome Bluetooth proxies with any USB Bluetooth Adapters you might have. This exceptional
# feature offers fault tolerant connection between the Bluetooth devices and Home Assistant.
