#
# Logger Component
#
# The logger component automatically logs all log messages through the serial
# port and through MQTT topics (if there is an MQTT client in the
# configuration). By default, all logs with a severity DEBUG or higher will be
# shown. Increasing the log level severity (to e.g INFO or WARN) can help with
# the performance of the application and memory size.
