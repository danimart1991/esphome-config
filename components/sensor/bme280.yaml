# BME280 Temperature+Pressure+Humidity Sensor
#
# The bme280 sensor platform allows you to use your BME280 (datasheet,
# Adafruit) temperature, pressure and humidity sensors with ESPHome. The sensor
# is used in Forced Mode where measurement is performed and then the sensor
# returns to sleep mode until next measurement. The IÂ²C or SPI is required to
# be set up in your configuration for this sensor to work.
